	<p class="underline-text"> MY Top 3 Journalism Stories</p>
	<ol>
		<li> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/17/world/asia/india-pollution-inequality.html" target="_blank"> Who Gets to Breathe Clean Air in New Delhi: <a/> This news feature by, <u> The New York Times, </u> was published in 2020 and the reason why it is one of my favorite journalism stories is because it combines visual data points with visual snippets of the subjects' day to day life. </li>

		<p><li><a href="https://youtu.be/d2uyH6cMNb4?si=9W1H3MDAg5tRDqaJ" target="_blank"> How World War 2 Began:</a> This is my favorite documentary on WW2, which is actually on YouTube by the content creator Ryan Chapman. I really enjoy this documentary because it doesn't just go straight into the start of WW2. Instead, it gives a lot of historical context to the buildup of WWs2 by going back to WW1. He also uses a lot of primary sources to explain his analysis.</li></p>

		<li><a href="https://a.co/d/ffdlBwW" target="_blank"> The Amplified Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana by Michael Azerrad </a> TThis is my favorite biography about the band Nirvana by music journalist Michael Azerrad. He wrote the original version of this book when the band was active–a.k.a when Kurt Cobain was alive–therefore, it is the closest we will probably ever get to an authorized biography of the band. The new edition of this book which came out in 2023, Azerrad revisits the book by adding recent commentary on his perspective during his time documenting the Grunge band in the early 90s. </li>
